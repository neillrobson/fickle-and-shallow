> Examples of unorthodox enterprise-level Vuex practices.

## Experiment Brainstorming

- Looped dispatches (action calls)
  - From outside Vuex
  - From inside a Vuex action
  - Include short timeouts (to simulate API calls)
- Looped commits (mutation calls)
  - From outside Vuex
  - From inside a Vuex action
  - Include short timeouts (to simulate API calls)
- Deeply-nested state mutations
  - Watch out for passing a `...spread` object that still ends up getting applied in a deep nesting circumstance
  - What watchers/triggers are hit? Shallow? Deep?
  - Duration of execution?
- Clone, mutate, and shallow-apply
  - See above (deep nesting)

- Load promises
  - None
  - Single blocking promise for loadAll
  - Promise map

### Measurement Criteria

- Track the number of reactive updates: do they get batched?
- Does the sequence block all other interactions?
- Memory consumption differences?

- Number of reactive updates
- Rendering degradation
  - Loading spinner
  - Reactive update delays
- Memory consumption
  - Max heap size
  - Garbage collection frequency
- Runtime *minus the awaits*

### Watch Counters

- Shallow, on `map`
- Deep, on `map`
- Shallow, on `map.abc.i`

## Looped Dispatch/Commit

### Experiment Setup

- Fifty (?) iterations, one of which is `abc`
- collatzAtKey action: rand await timeout
- collatzAtKey mutation: directly change `i` value

### Conclusions

- External/internal is negligible
- Commit is better than dispatch
- Frontloaded API calls is better than interspersed
  - Caveat: UI lockup is worse with frontloaded calls

## Nested Mutations

### Experiment Setup

- Twenty iterations
  - Ten fixed (_watch all of these_)
  - Ten random
  - Evenly distributed (rand/fixed/rand/fixed)
- Standard 10ms sleep per iteration: 200ms overall
- Variations:
  - Looped `setMapAtKey` in an action (10ms sleep per)
  - Pre-build `changeMap`, pass to `setMapAtKeys`
  - Clone and update `map`, pass to `setMap`

### Conclusions

ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm start
# or, equivalently,
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

Linting happens automatically via hisky and lint-staged. It can also be triggered manually with the command:

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
